<h2>
In chemistry class, the project we are working on was all about the big bang theory, and theories on the origin of our universe.<br>
So what my group did was we created a slide show presentation on the topic (the big bang theory). We also made a couple of slides <br>
dedicated to explaining the origin of our universe in the eyes of religion, specifically the Mayan roots of belief.

<h3> Reflection: In this project, I really learned to think like a kindergardener, and observe and ask lots of questions.</h3<
