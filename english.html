<h2>
In my english class I have done two projects so far, my normal "what we keep" assignment and my honnors assignment.<br>
My what we keep assignment was about three items, one from our past, one from our present, and one from our future.<br>
We had to find a mentor text and follow the style that they had. For my honors project, I had to take a picture of <br>
a common misconception about my generation and kind of derail the myth.

<h3> Reflection: In this project, I really learned a lot about myself and my direction I wanna go in life.
